    <h1>Personal Reflection: A Journey Through Survival and Self-Renewal</h1>

    <p>After years of being told I wasn’t good enough, that I would fail, and long arguments about money or whenever I discussed school stating that I had emotional problems or lacked the discipline to succeed—I now stand with a completed degree in Computer Science and only three semesters away from earning a dual degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I’ve completed 60 junior and senior-level credits, bringing me to 130 total credits with a final GPA of 3.72. I did this not because I am smarter, better, or more mature. I did it because of my aunt—and because I finally discovered I could access college loans, after years of believing my parents’ false claims that I was ineligible.</p>

    <p>In fact, I have Debbie to thank for stealing my college loan money. Normally, something like that would have thrown me into a rage. I would have argued with her for days, failed my classes, and spiraled into yet another breakdown. I never understood how someone's own mother could hate them as much as she hated me. But this time, when she denied taking the money, I saw the grin on her face and realized that her goal was never financial—it was to upset me, to make me fail. She had expertly done this to me ever since I returned home at 23.</p>

    <p>Instead of exploding, I brought my aunt into the situation. Her first reaction was disbelief: "Your mother wouldn't do that; that’s check fraud." At first, I agreed. But then Debbie sent me an email claiming she hadn’t taken the money—accompanied by an entire document filled with fabricated statements about things I allegedly said and did. That email exposed her for the manipulative liar she is. Combined with evidence of a $6,000 check deposited into her account, I went to the state police. They were shocked that she had even been able to cash it. I told them there were at least ten similar instances over the past five years, some involving checks for $25,000.</p>

    <h2>Manufactured Narratives and Emotional Deprivation</h2>

    <p>The only way I can begin to emotionally process what Debbie put me through during the first two decades of my life is to stop thinking of her as a mother—and instead see her more like a stepmother. She was someone physically present but emotionally absent, someone who never seemed to have my best interests at heart. She told me things a child should never hear and seemed to revel in control. One of my earliest memories she tells about me was the story of how I got my scar where she dropped me on a rock as a toddler, nearly killing me and leaving me with a scar that I still carry—a literal mark of the pain she brought into my life. That scar was only the beginning.</p>

    <p>Her talent for creating and sustaining damaging narratives about me was almost theatrical in its cruelty. She painted me as a broken child in need of fixing, and at 14, she took me from psychiatrist to psychiatrist, from one doctor to another, determined to find a diagnosis that never came. Each test returned normal, including evaluations for ADHD. Instead of being relieved that I was healthy, she expressed disappointment—as if my well-being undermined the story she had told others and perhaps even herself.</p>

    <h2>The Illusion of Poverty and the Withholding of Opportunity</h2>

    <p>I was raised under the false narrative that we were dirt poor. I wore old clothes, had very little to call my own, and was shamed for asking for anything beyond the bare minimum. The one toy I cherished as a child was returned to the store because it was deemed “too expensive.” That experience embedded in me a sense of unworthiness that took years to unwind. Only in adulthood did I begin to unravel the financial deception and manipulation she employed to maintain control. Understanding this helped explain the constant scarcity I experienced growing up and how tightly she guarded any perception of abundance or comfort.</p>

    <p>In 2015, after excelling academically with a 3.6 GPA at Piedmont Virginia Community College, I transferred to James Madison University full of hope. I entrusted Debbie with my summer earnings—$15,000—only to find myself broke within weeks. I was denied campus food and parking. She gave me $80 a month to survive, which covered little more than instant noodles. With no access to transportation after 5 p.m., I stayed in the library overnight just to make it through another day. My education at JMU was defined by hunger, sleep deprivation, and survival.</p>

    <p>I was also experiencing growing tension in my relationship with my then-girlfriend. Eventually, I discovered that Debbie had been secretly emailing her—subtly undermining our relationship by implying she would never be accepted into the family. These intrusions and manipulations further isolated me and amplified my emotional distress. As other students thrived, I struggled to function. I inquired about student loans, only to be told by both parents that I didn’t qualify due to family-owned land—yet that land never benefited me.</p>

    <p>When I began to fail a class under the strain, I was told outright that I wouldn’t be allowed to return to school. I snapped. In a moment of absolute desperation, I made the decision to alter a grade in the system. I now see that action for what it was: a tragic mistake born out of panic, pressure, and total abandonment. It was a turning point that nearly cost me everything.</p>

    <h2>Reclaiming Autonomy</h2>

    <p>Debbie’s ability to manufacture psychological stress and maintain emotional chaos was something I had come to expect. It echoed throughout my adolescence and into adulthood, each instance reinforcing the sense of instability that defined much of my life at home. She could generate anxiety out of thin air and sustain it with relentless consistency. Even the trust she established in my name was designed not to empower me, but to control me. Its terms would have kept me in financial limbo until the age of 50. Security was the illusion; control was the intent.</p>

    <p>Despite all this, I took my life back. I earned my degree in Computer Science. I kept my GPA high and am now pursuing a dual degree in Electrical Engineering because I see how artificial intelligence and automation are reshaping the world. I refuse to be sidelined by the very systems that once tried to break me.</p>

    <p>Letting Debbie manage my finances even once nearly ruined my future. The betrayal was made worse by revelations about her past. I later learned my grandfather, a Navy captain who received over $100,000 annually from his pension, cut her off when she was 37. Yet years earlier, in 1984, he had given her checks of $84,000 and $120,000 when she married a billionaire. That marriage lasted barely a year before he divorced her. The stories I had been told as a child unraveled one by one.</p>

    <h2>Remembering What Mattered</h2>

    <p>My memory is sharp and enduring. I remember the moments that mattered—even those that tried to offer a glimpse of joy. When I was six, we celebrated my grandfather’s 80th birthday. I remember the trip to your house, the laughter, the pool you filled for us that summer, and the Padres game we attended. Those moments remain etched in my mind, untouched by the chaos that surrounded them. They serve as proof that even amid dysfunction, small pockets of goodness existed—and they inspire the life I am actively building today: one rooted in self-determination, growth, and a future I define for myself.</p>
